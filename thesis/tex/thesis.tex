% Thesis-specific command definitions go here.

  % To LaTeX only some parts of your thesis put the

  % \includeonly{front} would only process front.tex.
  % \includeonly{front,intro,vita} would only process
  % front.tex, intro.tex, and vita.tex.
  % To print the final copy of your thesis put a '%'
  % in front of the \includeonly command and run LaTeX
  % three times to make sure that all cross-references
  % are correct.  Then run BibTeX once and LaTeX twice
  % more.
